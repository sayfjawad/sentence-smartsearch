     * Tests the functionality of the `CormodeLZSimilaritySearch` class to find sentences similar
     * to a given search sentence within a specified threshold using Cormode's LZ distance.
     * <p>
     * The test verifies that the method correctly identifies sentences that are close to
     * "Albert Heijn" from a list of sentences and ensures the output meets the expected results.
     * Specifically, the test checks that:
     * - Sentences similar to "Albert Heijn", such as "Albört H ijn" and "Alber Heijn", are included
     * in the result based on the threshold.
     * - Irrelevant sentences ("Action", "Blokker", etc.) are excluded from the result.
